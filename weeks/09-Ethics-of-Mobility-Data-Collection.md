Choose one of these datasets for the following tasks.

### GCN-LPA
Evaluate your GCN-LPA model on the dataset you selected. Compare the performance of GCN-LPA to the performance of a GCN with the same architecture and hyper-parameters.

### GraphSage
Using the supervised loss, compare GraphSage with mean aggregator to your implemented pooling aggregator (from week 7) on the dataset you selected.
