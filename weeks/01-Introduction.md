# Introduction
This domain centers on an augmeneted data-type: graph-based data, and a class of methods used to analyze such data: geometric deep learning / graph neural networks. The week will provide motivation and an introduciton to both topics.

## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:
- Introduction to machine learning (specifically deep learning) on graphs
- Introduction to graphs and the graph Laplacian
    

## Reading

Please read the following:
- [What is geometric deep learning?](https://medium.com/@flawnsontong1/what-is-geometric-deep-learning-b2adb662d91d)
- [Introduction to graph theory and deep learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-theory-and-deep-learning-know-hows-6556b0e9891b)
- [Machine Learning on graphs](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-tasks-on-graphs-7bc8f175119a)

The mathematical background in this paper will provide you with the necessary mathematical definitions to discuss graphs:

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions
- Describe one thing you found interesting in the reading. Describe what it is in your own words and why you found it interesting.
- Describe one thing that you found difficult to understand. Try to be specific about what you donâ€™t think you understand.
- Describe in your own words two machine learning tasks on graphs (2-3 sentences on each task).
