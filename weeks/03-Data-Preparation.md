# Domain specific techniques I: Intro to GCNs

## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:
* An introduction to Graph Neural Networks
* Build a graph convolutional network

## Reading

Please read the following:
* [Graph Convolutional Networks](http://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/)
* [Tutorial on Graph Neural Networks for Computer Vision and Beyond](https://medium.com/@BorisAKnyazev/tutorial-on-graph-neural-networks-for-computer-vision-and-beyond-part-1-3d9fada3b80d)
* Read slides 10-44 from the [presentation on GCN and GraphSage](http://snap.stanford.edu/proj/embeddings-www/files/nrltutorial-part2-gnns.pdf)

### Replication task
* Read Section 3 of the [GraphSage](https://www-cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/graphsage-nips17.pdf) paper.


## Tasks

Complete the following tasks:
* Run the [full training models](https://github.com/bknyaz/examples/blob/master/fc_vs_graph_train.py) from the tutorial comparing a fully connected network (FCN), convolutional network (CNN) and graph convolutional network (GCN). Report the results.
* Implement a 1-layer GCN and train it on a node classification task for the Cora dataset. Compare the performance of the GCN to an FCN and report the results.

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions
* In both MNIST and Cora you are training a neural network to perform a clasification task on your samples. However in the two implementations of the GCN, the graph plays a different role. Explain. (hint: who are the features, nodes and edges in each of these tasks).
* Describe one thing that you found difficult to understand in Section 3 of the paper. Try to be specific about what you donâ€™t think you understand.
