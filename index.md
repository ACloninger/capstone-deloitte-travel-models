# Introduction

This domain will investigate analysis of data lying on irregular structure, or graphs. This domain centers around understanding graph-based data and graphs as data. To approach this problem we will mainly be focusing on Graph Neural Networks.

Graphs and networks are playing an increasing role in modern machine learning and signal processing. We can view graph-based data as an augmented data structure, where in addition to having a feature representation for every datapoint (nodes in the graphs), we also have knowledge of the interactions and connectivity between points (graph edges). Graphs-based data is prevalent across domains such as biology (neuronal networks in the brain), computer science (social networks), electrical engineering (sensor networks), civil engineering (traffic networks) and many, many more.

Some questions we will be answering throughout this domain:
- How to model irregularly structured data?
- How to scale models and methods to large-scale graphs?
- How to benchmark machine learning approaches on graph-based data?

While a vast array of machine learning techniques rely on graphs and graph-based representations to analyze data (hierarchical clustering, spectral clustering, manifold learning, community detection, manifold/graph regularization), in this domain we will focus on geometric deep learning, or graph neural networks.

## Result replication (introduction to topic)

We will delve into this area via the following two papers:
- [Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs](https://www-cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/graphsage-nips17.pdf), Hamilton, Ying and Leskovec, NeurIPS 2017
- [Unifying Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Label Propagation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06755), Wang and Leskovec 2020

and replicate results on datasets from [Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00687)


# COVID-19
The course staff recognizes that the current situation is changing on a rapid basis, and specifically presents challenges for learning. You may be concerned about your own health, as well as the health of your friends and family. You may be dealing with financial concerns or balancing new responsibilities such as childcare. While several months have passed since the beginning of the pandemic, these remain challenging times for all of us from many perspectives. We encourage you to be compassionate, patient and forgiving of the mistakes we are all going to make in continuing to adapt to the remote learning environment. Please reach out to the course staff as necessary so we can help you overcome any difficulties to in this course despite current circumstances.

# Section Participation

Participation in the weekly discussion section is *mandatory*. Each
week, you are responsible for doing the reading/task assigned in the
[schedule](#schedule). Come to section prepared to ask questions about
and discuss the results of these tasks.

Each week, turn in answers to the weekly questions to Canvas. These
questions are meant to focus your work for the week and help prepare
you for discussion. If you have questions about your work, please ask
them in section or office hours (I will rarely comment on your
submission).

You are responsible for the entire weekly reading/task, even if
portions are not covered in the weekly questions, as these are designed to help you in your replication. The weekly tasks are the building blocks for the project proposals/assignments due at the
end of the quarter.
